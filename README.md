# WEFsolutions
The aim of this project is to build up a database of technologies and nature-based solutions for water, energy, and food supply. The models shall exhibit the physical, environmental and socioeconomic properties of the solutions, as well as, the nexus among them and to related systems.

A template for adding and editing WEF solutions will be provided soon. 

This repository is generated from rli_template. More information see below.

# rli_template
Template repository for creating new projects under the RLI's umbrella

## Get started

Simply click on the green `Use this template` button on the left of the `Clone or download` button.

The detailed instructions to create a new repository from this template can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

## src folder

This folder is where you should place the code of your package (package name to be edited in `setup.py` under name)

You can install it locally for developing with

    python setup.py install
    
More details for packaging are available on [https://packaging.python.org](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)


## Docs

To build the docs simply go to the `docs` folder

    cd docs

Install the requirements

    pip install -r docs_requirements.txt

and run

    make html

The output will then be located in `docs/_build/html` and can be opened with your favorite browser

## Code linting

In this template, 3 possible linters are proposed:
- flake8 only sends warnings and error about linting (PEP8)
- pylint sends warnings and error about linting (PEP8) and also allows warning about imports order
- black sends warning but can also fix the files for you

You can perfectly use the 3 of them or subset, at your preference. Don't forget to edit `.travis.yml` if you want to desactivate the automatic testing of some linters!
